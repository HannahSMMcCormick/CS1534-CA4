## Introduction 

### Home Page

#### For the home page I decided too go with a fun sea theme. I had originally had a link bar but opted to change this for some 'fun' images instead. The challenge I had with this was getting everything to align correctly even when the screen got smaller and getting stuck in what I call 'div hell' as shown below

# <div class="1">
#    <div class="2">
#       <div class="3">
#       </div>
#    </div>
# </div>


### Portfolio Page 

#### I decided to utalise my portfolio page to show my Javascript skills since it seems to be my weakest lanuage. Ive included some popups to show information about me, my experience and my projects(pending something worth showing).


### Chat page

#### I tried to design the chat page like most chat applications with alternatating messages for the sender and reciever, different colours for the bubbles and joined and leaving messages. I had trouble implementing a user is typing message. I had intending to have the persons username change colour in the sidenav  however I didnt know how to differentaite the users to only have their username change colour and not all of them.


## In the future

### In the future I'd like to clean some elements up, add some more functions to the chat application like the user is typing message. I'd like to implement a database so that I can create logins to save chat seesions and allow users to have different chat sessions at the one time. This login page was initially implemneted but was later removed due to time constraints.
