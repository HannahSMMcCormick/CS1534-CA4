## Introduction 

### Home Page

#### For the home page I decided too go with a fun sea theme. I had originally had a link bar but opted to change this for some 'fun' images instead. The challenge I had with this was getting everything to align correctly even when the screen got smaller and getting stuck in what I call 'div hell' as shown below

# <div class="1">
#    <div class="2">
#       <div class="3">
#       </div>
#    </div>
# </div>


### Portfolio Page 

#### I decided to utalise my portfolio page to show my Javascript skills since it seems to be my weakest lanuage. Ive included some popups to show information about me, my experience and my projects(pending something worth showing)
